# 2021datacleaning_emergent

Hello future Emergent boards and random readers!

My name is Gunho Lee, who was the co-instructor of *2021 Emergent Data Cleaning Workshop* along with my colleague *Steve Rustom*.

I created this git repository in order to save the contents of the workshop. In addition, the future Emergent Consulting team would be able to utilize it to revise (or obtain) basic data manipulation skills in **Python**.

Before downloading the files and following the workshop, please make sure the followings:  
- We designed Colab Notebook, meaning that you better use Google Colab Environment.
- You find two notebook files; **Complete Exercise.ipynb** & **Exercise.ipynb**. The latter file does not contain full answers, meaning that you may try to fill up and compare the answers in the complete file. This way would you train most efficiently.
- Do not forget to take enough rest and sleep as health is of uttermost importance!

Last but not least, I would like to thank *Steve Rustom* who was working on this with me.
